libdargui : an interface to libdar


Freepascal applications can not access C++ libraries directly due to differences
in function name mangling.

libdargui provides a C interface to a small number of libdar functions to enable
DarGUI to access them directly instead of calling commandline dar.

libdargui is envisaged mainly as a way of overcoming current limitations of
DarGUI when opening dar archives and should enable handling of archives stored
on multiple disks and faster loading of archives.

Drawbacks are that libdargui is compiled against specific versions of libdar -
this will probably complicate installation procedure, with multiple versions of
libdargui provided, or reduce the number of distributions on which DarGUI will
work.
Also, at today's date the program crashes and closes if you answer 'No' to a question....

When writing libdargui I have drawn heavily on the examples provided by Denis
Corbin in his LIBDAR APPLICATION INTERFACE TUTORIAL and "How to use C code in
Free Pascal projects" by G. Marcou, E. Engler, A. Varnek.
