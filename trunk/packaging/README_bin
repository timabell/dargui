README for DarGUI binary tarball
================================

20 February 2011

Thank you for downloading the binary tarball for DarGUI.

To install DarGUI open a console and cd to the directory containing this file.
Execute ./install.sh as root or sudo ./install.sh depending on your Linux distribution

To uninstall DarGUI execute ./uninstall.sh

To run DarGUI type dargui in a console

DarGUI has been compiled using the GTK+ libraries, which are installed by default
on many modern Linux distributions.
If, however, dargui fails to run because of missing libraries try typing
ldd /usr/bin/dargui in a console. You will see a list of the libraries required
by DarGUI and a warning if any are not found. The name of the library will help you
work out which package you need to install to fix the missing library.

DarGUI also needs the following programs to work correctly:
       dar
       xterm
       bash
       libvte9

To use DarGUI's scheduling capabilities, atd and cron must be running.

Language Support:
DarGUI now has multilingual support.
The language template file dargui.pot is installed in /usr/share/dargui/locales
If you can improve the Spanish translation or are able to help with translation
to another language please contact the author at the email address below.

NB: Some functions of DarGUI may not work when used with a version of DAR which is 
using DAR's Swedish or German localisation files. This can be fixed by deleting 
or renaming the DAR localisation file dar.mo . Be warned, however, that this will
mean that commandline DAR will then function only in English.
