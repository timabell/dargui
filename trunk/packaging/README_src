================================

27 March 2009

Thank you for downloading the source tarball for DarGUI.

DarGUI has been written using FreePascal and the Lazarus IDE.
You will need to install both in order to compile this source.
They can be found in the repositories of some distributions
and packages for most platforms can be downloaded from
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=89339

Documentation for FreePascal can be found at
http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/FPC_documentation

Documentation for Lazarus and a number of tutorials can be found at
http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/Lazarus_Documentation
Beginners will also find most Delphi beginners' tutorials useful.
