<p>Dar is an extremely versatile and powerful tool
and&nbsp;DarGUI is not planned to be a means of&nbsp;accessing
all its features. Instead, DarGUI is intended to simplify the most common tasks
of making backup&nbsp;archives and restoring files from these and
to provide a small number of additional features. DarGUI version 0.3.1
provides the following features:</p>

Corbin's FEATURES document.</p>


<div class="variablelist">
<dl>


  <dt><a name="desc-encryption"></a><span class="term">Filters</span></dt>


  <dd>
    
    <p>DarGUI is able to backup everything from a single file to
an entire filesystem. Additionally a mechanism of filters enables the
inclusion or exclusion of individual&nbsp;files or directories
while backing up or restoring a directory tree. Similarly, a secondary
filter mechanism permits to exclude some branches of a directory tree,
or to only include some branches. <a href="features.html" title="Features">(back to top)</a></p>


  </dd>


  <dt><a name="desc-diff-backup"></a><span class="term">Differential backup</span></dt>


  <dd>
    
    <p>When making a backup with DarGUI, you have the option of
making a full backup or a differential backup. A full backup, as
expected, makes a backup of all files as specified on the command line
(with or without filters). Instead, a differential backup, (over filter
mechanism), saves only files that have changed since a given reference
backup. Additionally, files that existed in the reference backup and
which do not exist anymore at the time of the differential backup are
recorded in the backup. At recovery time, (unless you deactivate it),
restoring a differential backup will update changed files and new
files, but also remove files that have been recorded as deleted. Note
that the reference backup can be a full backup or another differential
backup. This way you can make a first full backup, then many
differential backup, each taking as reference the last backup made.

  </dd>


  <dt><a name="desc-slices"></a><span class="term">Slices</span></dt>


  <dd>
    
    <p>DarGUI can split an archive over several removable media
whatever their number is and whatever their size is. Thus DarGUI is
able to save over old floppy disk, CD-R, DVD-R, CD-RW, DVD-RW, Zip,
Jazz, etc... KDar is not concerned by un/mounting a removable medium,
instead it is independent of hardware. Given the size, it will split
the archive in several files (called SLICES), eventually pausing before
creating the next one, allowing this way, the user to (un)mount a
medium, burn the file on CD-R, send it by email. KDar can also backup
data to one slice whatever its size is. Additionally, the size of the
first slice can be specified separately, if for example you want first
to fulfill a partially filled disk before starting using empty ones.
Last, at restoration time, KDar will just pause and prompt the user
asking a slice only if it is missing.
    <a href="features.html" title="Features">(back
to top)</a></p>


  </dd>


  <dt><a name="desc-compression"></a><span class="term">Compression</span></dt>


  <dd>
    
    <p>KDar can use compression. Actually only the gzip and bzip2
algorithms are implemented, but some room has been made for any other
compression algorithm. Note that, compression is made before slices are
created, which means that using compression with slices will not make
slices smaller, but will probably make less slices in the backup.
    <a href="features.html" title="Features">(back
to top)</a></p>


  </dd>


  <dt><a name="desc-selective-compression"></a><span class="term">Selective compression</span></dt>


  <dd>
    
    <p>KDar can be given a special filter that determines which
files will be compressed or not. This way you can speed up the backup
operation by not trying to compress *.mp3, *.mpg, *.zip, *.gz and other
already compressed files. Moreover another mechanism allows you to say
that files under a given size (whatever their name is), will not be
compressed.
    <a href="features.html" title="Features">(back
to top)</a></p>


  </dd>


  <dt><a name="desc-direct-access"></a><span class="term">Direct access</span></dt>


  <dd>
    
    <p>Even using compression KDar does not have to read the
entire backup to extract one file. This way if you just want to restore
one file from a huge backup, the process will be much faster than using
tar.
KDar first reads the catalog (i.e. the contents of the backup),
then it goes directly to the location of the saved file(s) you want to
restore and proceed to restoration. In particular using slices KDar
will ask only for the slice(s) containing the file(s) to restore.
    <a href="features.html" title="Features">(back
to top)</a></p>


  </dd>


  <dt><a name="desc-hard-links"></a><span class="term">Archive testing</span></dt>


  <dd>
    
    <p>thanks to CRC (cyclic redundancy checks), Dar is able to
detect data corruption in the archive. If data corruption occurs in a
file it will not be possible to restore it but the remaining files will
be restoredothers even when compression is used.
    <a href="features.html" title="Features">(back
to top)</a></p>


  </dd>


  <dt><a name="desc-isolation"></a><span class="term">Isolation</span></dt>


  <dd>
    
    <p>The catalog (i.e.: the contents of an archive), can be
extracted (this operation is called isolation) to a small file. This
catalog can in turn be used as reference for making a differential
archive. There is no more need to provide an archive to be able to
create a differential backup over it. Just its catalog is necessary.
    <a href="features.html" title="Features">(back
to top)</a></p>


  </dd>


  <dt><a name="desc-config"></a><span class="term">Restore individual files</span></dt>


  <dd>
    
    <p>You can restore any combination of individual files and
directories by selecting them in the tree-view display. DarGUI's
selection tools make it possible to select all files with a particular
suffix or named in a particular way, for example all files ending in
.html can be easily selected for restoration.
    <a href="features.html" title="Features">(back
to top)</a></p>


  </dd>


  <dt><a name="desc-flat"></a><span class="term">Flat restoration</span></dt>


  <dd>
    
    <p>It is possible to restore any file without restoring the
directories and subdirectories it was in at the time of the backup. If
this option is enabled, all files will be restored in the root
directory whatever their real position is.
    <a href="features.html" title="Features">(back
to top)</a></p>


  </dd>


  <dt><a name="desc-nodump"></a><span class="term">Pause between slices</span></dt>


  <dd>
    
    <p>Dar can be instructed to pause once a slice has
been written. This feature can be used to enable writing to CD between slices, for
example.
    <a href="features.html" title="Features">(back
to top)</a></p>


  </dd>


  <dt><a name="desc-substitution"></a><span class="term">Timestamp archive names</span></dt>


  <dd>
    
    <p> DarGUI can automatically include the date and time of creation in the name of a DAR archive.
