<h1>DarGUI</h1>
<h2>Introduction to DarGUI</h2>
<p>DarGUI is a graphical interface to Denis Corbin's <a href="http://dar.linux.free.fr/">DAR</a> backup
utility. With DarGUI you can examine the contents of dar format archive
files, extract files and create new archives.</p>
<p>Other features which may be added to DarGUI in the future are</p>
<ul>
<li>access to other features of dar</li>
<li>the ability to produce backup scripts</li>
</ul>
<h2>DarGUI compared with other applications</h2>
<p>DarGUI does not use the libdar library directly so it will
always be slower than applications such as KDar which do so. However,
this should only become noticeable when attempting to open very large
archives.</p>
<p>DarGUI does not directly provide such a wide range of options
as KDar and is unlikely ever to do so. However, DarGUI can be used as a
labour-saving device to produce a dar command which can be further
refined by the user to perform more complex tasks.</p>
DarGUI uses GTK libraries that are installed by default in most Linux
distributions: usually the only additional software which needs to be
installed is dar, which is&nbsp;available for most distributions as
a standard .rpm or .deb package.
